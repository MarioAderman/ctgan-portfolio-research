# Project Overview

This project is a research initiative focused on portfolio optimization using a modified Conditional Tabular Generative Adversarial Network (CTGAN). The goal is to generate realistic financial data to improve portfolio allocation strategies. The project is a collaboration between Arturo Cifuentes, Domingo Ramirez, and Fintual AGF.

The core of the project is a backtesting engine that compares the performance of different portfolio allocation strategies. The strategies are based on historical data and data generated by a CTGAN model. The project uses the Uryasev and Rockafeller optimization model to find the optimal portfolio that minimizes the Conditional Value at Risk (CVaR) for a given expected return.

The project is implemented in Python and uses the following libraries:

*   **pandas:** For data manipulation and analysis.
*   **scikit-learn:** For PCA and t-SNE.
*   **sdv (Synthetic Data Vault):** For the CTGAN model.
*   **hdbscan:** For clustering.
*   **scipy:** For linear programming.

# Key Files

*   **`main.py`:** The main entry point of the project. It loads the configuration, loads the data, and runs the backtests.
*   **`config.json`:** The configuration file for the project. It contains parameters such as the paths to the data, the backtesting models to use, and various hyperparameters for the optimization.
*   **`src/backtester.py`:** The core of the project. It contains the `Backtester` class, which is responsible for running the backtests.
*   **`src/generators/gan_generator.py`:** Implements the `CTGANGenerator` class, which is responsible for generating synthetic data using a CTGAN model.
*   **`src/generators/historical_generator.py`:** Implements the `HistoricalGenerator` class, which is responsible for generating data based on historical data.
*   **`src/uryasev_optimization.py`:** Implements the Uryasev and Rockafeller optimization model.
*   **`src/data/asset_prices.csv`:** The asset prices data.
*   **`src/data/features.csv`:** The features data.

# Building and Running

Before running the project, you need to activate the conda environment:

```bash
conda activate ctgan-portfolio
```

To run the project, execute the following command in your terminal:

```bash
python main.py
```

This will run the backtests with the default configuration specified in `config.json`. You can modify the `config.json` file to change the backtesting models, the hyperparameters for the optimization, and other parameters.

# Development Conventions

The project follows the standard Python coding conventions (PEP 8). The code is well-structured and modular. The project uses type hints to improve code readability and maintainability. The project also includes a `.gitignore` file to exclude unnecessary files from the git repository.
